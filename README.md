# Railroad
This repository contains a program I wrote for my Artificial Intelligence class to find and display the shortest path between railroad stations in the U.S. using the A* algorithm. This program can be run through the command line (python railroad.py START_CITY_HERE END_CITY_HERE) and will display the searching algorithm as it progresses, with the shortest path being displayed in red.
